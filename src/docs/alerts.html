      </div><p>In 2016, <a href="http://www.siena.qld.edu.au">Siena Catholic College</a> at Sippy Downs on the Sunshine Coast was looking for a way to reduce energy costs, reduce CO2 emissions and provide a more sustainable campus.</p><p>The school engaged <a href="https://planetarkpower.com/case-studies/siena-catholic-college">Planet Ark Power</a> to create a large-scale solar system, consisting of 80 KW of rooftop solar using 308 solar panels and 3 inverters. Since installing the system in 2016, the school has achieved the following benefits:</p><ul><li>Anticipated generation of 120,000 kWh to mitigate against cost of future energy price rises</li><li>Estimated annual savings of $20,000 in energy costs</li><li>Estimated annual emission savings of 92 tonnes of carbon (the equivalent 500,000 kms travelled by car).</li></ul><h2>Lemontree feedlot, Darling Downs</h2><div class="qg-cut-in">
