# Queensland Government Web Template

**If you are using assets from this Repo, please send an email to oss.products@dsiti.qld.gov.au so we can add you to our change management communications list**

_This project is currently a work in progress._

## Repo structure
This repo should contain three main branches:
- working: For integrating features for the next version
- beta: For testing
- master: The current live assets

### Creating new branches
To keep the repository clean, branches should be prefixed into categories with a forwardslash /. Categories come from JIRA and are (note capitalisation): 
- Bugfix: For bugs and errors for the next release
- Feature: For new features
- Hotfix: For critical bugs and errors which will be merged into the current release
Example: Bugfix/QOL-841-Fix-bugs-for-tmr

Please make sure to setup browserstack _config file_ (step 3) and run _gulp serve_ before running browserstack E2E tests

BROWSERSTACK_ACCESS_KEY = key
PROXYHOST = proxyhost (leave blank if no proxy)
PROXYPORT = proxyport (leave blank if no proxy)
PROXYPROTOCOL = proxyprotocol (leave blank if no proxy)
